//! Statically initialized lookup tables.
//!
//! Whenever a `Board` is created, these are also created as well. Calling `Helper::new()` will
//! initialize the tables the first time it's called, and successive calls won't waste time
//! initializing the table.
//!
//! It is highly recommended to go through a `Helper` to access these tables, as the access will
//! guarantee that the tables are initialized in the first place.
//!
//! If you want the same functions, but can ensure the Tables are initalized, see [`helper::prelude`]
//! for those raw functions.
